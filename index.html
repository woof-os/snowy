          <h2>Free</h2>
          <p>
            Woof OS is (and will be) free as in freedom. Giving you the best
            experience and the rights is our focus. Everything we do on Woof OS
            is for you, not for us. It is free as in cost which makes it so that
            anyone can use Woof OS.

          <h2>Software</h2>
          <p>
            Woof OS uses the pacman package manager making it easy and efficient
            to manage packages on your system. We also include the chaotic AUR
            making it easier to find binaries of AUR packages.

            choosing what software they use and using tiling window managers.
